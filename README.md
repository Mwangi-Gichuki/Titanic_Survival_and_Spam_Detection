# Titanic_Survival

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective

The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank on its maiden voyage crossing the atlantic from Southampton on its way to New York.

The titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for creating machine learning models. Although the data is ancient in data science terms, its accuracy, completeness and an already determined outcome makes it especially useful in both learning and practising on machine learning models.

### Methods Used

* Data understanding to know the unique characteristics of the data set provided
* Data cleaning to remove null values and columns that are not required for the analysis
* Perform EDA
* Perform any necessary feature engineering 
* Check of multicollinearity
* Start building the model using KNN 
* Try to improve the model using LDA
* Try to improve the model by changing number of K
* Challenging our model

### Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* sklearn
* math
* statsmodels
* scipy.stats
* seaborn

## Project Description

In this exercise, we will use the dataset in trying to predict whether a passenger was likely to survive based on characteristics such as the class in which they were travelling, their age and whether or not they were travelling alone or with other family members.

* Survival 0 = No, 1 = Yes
* Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd Sex
* Age in years
* sibsp # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
* parch # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
* Ticket number
* Passenger fare
* Cabin number
* Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

## Getting Started

A  model thatcan be used to determine whether a passenger survived given the unique combination of characteristics that define them eg. port of embarking, age etc.

The following approaches will be used to find the best model for the prediction:

* KNN
* LDA
* Decision tree

## Spam Detection

Spam Detection

There are many ways in which ones email address, phone number and other contact information can be come a target for spam messaging. This range from malicious data harvesting from websites and social media pages to self registrations when registering for certain services such as banking and telephone or internet services.

This therefore means it would be very hard for an individual to constantly go through all their messages and emails categorising them as either reasonable messages or spam.

Spam detection is an integral part of most email service providers, they use an algorithm that detects spam and saves them to a spam folder thus ensuring that only important emails are shhown in the important folders. The algorithm that is used for spam detection should be therefore very accurate or it may lead to misclassification of emails, sending important emails to spam or spam showing up in the important folders.

## Project Description

In this exercise, we will be trying to come up with a Naive Bayes Classifier that accurately predicts the email type and deals with it accordingly.

The following approaches will be used to find the best model for the prediction:

* LDA
* Naive Bayes
