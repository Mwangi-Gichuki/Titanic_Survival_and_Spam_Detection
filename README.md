# Titanic_Survival

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective

The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank on its maiden voyage crossing the atlantic from Southampton on its way to New York.

The titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for creating machine learning models. Although the data is ancient in data science terms, its accuracy, completeness and an already determined outcome makes it especially useful in both learning and practising on machine learning models.

### Methods Used

* Data understanding to know the unique characteristics of the data set provided
* Data cleaning to remove null values and columns that are not required for the analysis
* Perform EDA
* Perform any necessary feature engineering 
* Check of multicollinearity
* Start building the model using KNN 
* Try to improve the model using LDA
* Try to improve the model by changing number of K
* Challenging our model

### Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* sklearn
* math
* statsmodels
* scipy.stats
* seaborn

## Project Description

In this exercise, we will use the dataset in trying to predict whether a passenger was likely to survive based on characteristics such as the class in which they were travelling, their age and whether or not they were travelling alone or with other family members.

* Survival 0 = No, 1 = Yes
* Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd Sex
* Age in years
* sibsp # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
* parch # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
* Ticket number
* Passenger fare
* Cabin number
* Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

## Getting Started

A  model thatcan be used to determine whether a passenger survived given the unique combination of characteristics that define them eg. port of embarking, age etc.

The following approaches will be used to find the best model for the prediction:

* KNN
* LDA
* Decision tree
